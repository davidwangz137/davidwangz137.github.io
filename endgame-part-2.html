</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>I got sick which is wonderful for productivity. I'm still experimenting with how much time I need to recover and managing my energy levels. Not sure if I'm making the optimal use of my time but I'll iterate on what I have. Basically work for an hour or so then take a break. I wonder what I should do in my break? Something mindless so to let my mind not have to focus? Or something mildly stimulating like light gaming? I'll try different things and note the effects.</p>
<p>I'm thinking of doing some algebraic topology after I finish the assignments for CS489. The assignments don't look that bad since I can't do half the assignment which requires access to a cluster. I can set my own up on Amazon but I'd rather do something else. We'll see then.</p>
<p>I find that I like writing these articles now. They allow me to destress throughout the day. I can write these with a medium level of focus but some parts can be shit since I stopped caring too much about it. I just want there to be some good information in these sentences which requires some coherence. But I'm not trying to condense at all or be precise like in a proof so it doesn't take extreme focus. I noticed that writing my real analysis assignments (the act of writing itself, not even solving the problems) is very intense. I guess its because there is some checking involved when I'm writing it so that activates a lot of my knowledge of the course.</p>
<p>I might actually get a new computer, since this machine is actually noticeably slow. I think a large bottleneck for me is actually not being able to bring out my laptop and start typing immediately when I want to work. Of course there is the computation time but when I'm just writing code to play around with or writing up assignments that is definitely not the bottleneck. I'll continue to think about it. Really I don't lose much time there is a barrier to working on my computer which I'd like to overcome.</p>
