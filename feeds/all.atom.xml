That would be fun but I feel like dedicating my time to other pursuits would be more interesting and be better since I'm not going to be a web developer. Saying that, back to work. I'm going to post a few things here and now about what I'm currently doing and some thoughts I have. I keep a journal so I'll try to only write insightful things. I might add a comment system later so people to comment on what I write (and point out my glaring errors/fallacies) but that is for another time.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry></feed>
