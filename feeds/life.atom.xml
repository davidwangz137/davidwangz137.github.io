I made a few mistakes but overall I solved all questions. I'm feeling pretty good about it. I'm slowly moving away from trying to get high grades in everything and instead focusing on learning more things by reading textbooks and just coding. Really reading over the notes of these courses doesn't really teach much and gets demoralizing over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm trying to slowly reform my worldview so it is more accurate but also faster. I think one way to do this is to continually read so that the mind often encounters new situations which cannot be resolved by the current system. Then the mind can try to adapt the system to handle the situation. But of course, some problems are insurmountable and thinking about them at depth without much of a handle on it is like a brute force search for solutions without revealing much insight about the problem. So I'm still trying to find a way to obtain a steady stream of improvement. I used to read &lt;a href="aeon.co"&gt;Aeon&lt;/a&gt; often but its not really a steady stream (some articles about history bore me. Some of the ethics articles don't present convincing arguments). I guess I can frequent Hacker news more for technology related topics. But I guess for big reformations I'll have to hit the books. One thing that I have realized is that having a guide through a book is really useful for understanding the content. Some books are dense and indigestible though they contain very powerful information ("bombs"). Only through introspection and hard consideration are these books ("nuclear stockpiles") accessible. Of course thats a fine price to pay considering the gains. But I have to approach these with the right mindset or else the information will just sail right past me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My energy levels have been good recently ever since I've recovered from the cold. I'm thinking of creating a logging category because these posts seem banal and really if I do produce good content then I'll want those to be labeled somehow.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Endgame Part 2</title><link href="https://davidwangz137.github.io/endgame-part-2.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-11-26T12:03:00+01:00</published><updated>2016-11-26T12:03:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Zhiyuan Wang</name></author><id>tag:davidwangz137.github.io,2016-11-26:endgame-part-2.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I got sick which is wonderful for productivity. I'm still experimenting with how much time I need to recover and managing my energy levels. Not sure if I'm making the optimal use of my time but I'll iterate on what I have. Basically work for an hour or so then take a break. I wonder what I should do in my break? Something mindless so to let my mind not have to focus? Or something mildly stimulating like light gaming? I'll try different things and note the effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm thinking of doing some algebraic topology after I finish the assignments for CS489. The assignments don't look that bad since I can't do half the assignment which requires access to a cluster. I can set my own up on Amazon but I'd rather do something else. We'll see then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find that I like writing these articles now. They allow me to destress throughout the day. I can write these with a medium level of focus but some parts can be shit since I stopped caring too much about it. I just want there to be some good information in these sentences which requires some coherence. But I'm not trying to condense at all or be precise like in a proof so it doesn't take extreme focus. I noticed that writing my real analysis assignments (the act of writing itself, not even solving the problems) is very intense. I guess its because there is some checking involved when I'm writing it so that activates a lot of my knowledge of the course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I might actually get a new computer, since this machine is actually noticeably slow. I think a large bottleneck for me is actually not being able to bring out my laptop and start typing immediately when I want to work. Of course there is the computation time but when I'm just writing code to play around with or writing up assignments that is definitely not the bottleneck. I'll continue to think about it. Really I don't lose much time there is a barrier to working on my computer which I'd like to overcome.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry></feed>
