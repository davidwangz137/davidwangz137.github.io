I've never got the the last two chapters due to the use of mathematical logic which I've never seen before. Maybe I should revisit it. The book was highly interesting, destroying my hopes in an easy mathematical model of group decision making and really solidified by example the various tensions that can occur between different actors in the same "game".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are pitfalls of modeling scenarios in the real world as a game as with all modeling. But proposing a model and then iteratively refining it with observations is a way to gain a deeper understanding of the world so I'll take the risk for now. One scenario is modeling scenarios where payoffs only happen in the end and this is contingent on the cooperation of both parties. Really this is a precarious scenario if one party's payoff is completely dependent on what amounts to basically the good will of the the other party. There is no good strategy to play other than hope that the other party doesn't demand too much of you in order to get your payoff. Dealing with people who abuse this really leaves a bad taste in my mouth. Because you are now owned by the other party (insofar as you value the reward they will give you).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure what to do really. One of the things about game theory was to make me give up hope in some circumstances. No matter how you play these types of games the other party can fuck you over without any repercussions (without extreme escalation which very few would resort to). So I've just been trying to avoid such situations, investing as less as I can into such things and trying harder in my life to make sure that if I do have to take such losses inadvertently then I have enough to get out of such losses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes life and other people just fuck you over. I've accepted this. But I have to remember to act on this knowledge. This is one of the bigger optimizations that I can make since it deals with some of the nastiest situations a person can get into. So I'll have to learn how to discern these situations before they occur and avoid them. It is okay to be more stringent here. Its like taking care of yourself so you don't get sick: when you get sick its too late.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Endgame Part 3</title><link href="https://davidwangz137.github.io/endgame-part-3.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-12-11T16:39:00+01:00</published><updated>2016-12-11T16:39:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Zhiyuan Wang</name></author><id>tag:davidwangz137.github.io,2016-12-11:endgame-part-3.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I finished my graph theory exam on Friday. I made a few mistakes but overall I solved all questions. I'm feeling pretty good about it. I'm slowly moving away from trying to get high grades in everything and instead focusing on learning more things by reading textbooks and just coding. Really reading over the notes of these courses doesn't really teach much and gets demoralizing over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm trying to slowly reform my worldview so it is more accurate but also faster. I think one way to do this is to continually read so that the mind often encounters new situations which cannot be resolved by the current system. Then the mind can try to adapt the system to handle the situation. But of course, some problems are insurmountable and thinking about them at depth without much of a handle on it is like a brute force search for solutions without revealing much insight about the problem. So I'm still trying to find a way to obtain a steady stream of improvement. I used to read &lt;a href="aeon.co"&gt;Aeon&lt;/a&gt; often but its not really a steady stream (some articles about history bore me. Some of the ethics articles don't present convincing arguments). I guess I can frequent Hacker news more for technology related topics. But I guess for big reformations I'll have to hit the books. One thing that I have realized is that having a guide through a book is really useful for understanding the content. Some books are dense and indigestible though they contain very powerful information ("bombs"). Only through introspection and hard consideration are these books ("nuclear stockpiles") accessible. Of course thats a fine price to pay considering the gains. But I have to approach these with the right mindset or else the information will just sail right past me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My energy levels have been good recently ever since I've recovered from the cold. I'm thinking of creating a logging category because these posts seem banal and really if I do produce good content then I'll want those to be labeled somehow.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Endgame Part 2</title><link href="https://davidwangz137.github.io/endgame-part-2.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-11-26T12:03:00+01:00</published><updated>2016-11-26T12:03:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Zhiyuan Wang</name></author><id>tag:davidwangz137.github.io,2016-11-26:endgame-part-2.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I got sick which is wonderful for productivity. I'm still experimenting with how much time I need to recover and managing my energy levels. Not sure if I'm making the optimal use of my time but I'll iterate on what I have. Basically work for an hour or so then take a break. I wonder what I should do in my break? Something mindless so to let my mind not have to focus? Or something mildly stimulating like light gaming? I'll try different things and note the effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm thinking of doing some algebraic topology after I finish the assignments for CS489. The assignments don't look that bad since I can't do half the assignment which requires access to a cluster. I can set my own up on Amazon but I'd rather do something else. We'll see then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find that I like writing these articles now. They allow me to destress throughout the day. I can write these with a medium level of focus but some parts can be shit since I stopped caring too much about it. I just want there to be some good information in these sentences which requires some coherence. But I'm not trying to condense at all or be precise like in a proof so it doesn't take extreme focus. I noticed that writing my real analysis assignments (the act of writing itself, not even solving the problems) is very intense. I guess its because there is some checking involved when I'm writing it so that activates a lot of my knowledge of the course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I might actually get a new computer, since this machine is actually noticeably slow. I think a large bottleneck for me is actually not being able to bring out my laptop and start typing immediately when I want to work. Of course there is the computation time but when I'm just writing code to play around with or writing up assignments that is definitely not the bottleneck. I'll continue to think about it. Really I don't lose much time there is a barrier to working on my computer which I'd like to overcome.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry></feed>
