I believe that during these times I should rest in order to recover my energy but I don't. There are periods of being slightly tired and so I've gotten used to pushing forwards until my focus comes back. But when I've actually become fatigued this leads to somewhat terrible time sink of me trying to do something but due to my lack of energy for the whole time it proceeds at half or even slower rate than what I'd have if I could focus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish I could have a better awareness of my mental state. The problem that occurs for detecting lack of energy is that you need to ping for your energy level but if you have low energy then you may forget to ping and then you get into the time sinkhole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spend some good amount of time worrying about things as well. Some of the things I worry about are unboundable and really if they happen then it just sucks. I can only live life in a way that minimizes risk. Because I didn't have a good awareness and desire to think about the situation I was in I lost many opportunities and performed quite suboptimally. I believe a stronger situational awareness would have helped me mitigate these problems. So now I prepare, but I still have to find a good balance for how much energy I should spend towards this. There are many rewards for being situationally aware such as the ability to capitalize on opportunities. I don't recall any opportunities that I have cashed in on due to heightened awareness though I'll now try to be more aware and see if I get any positive results. If so, then this would be good motivation. I don't want to drop my guard since everything seems to be going well and then get rekt.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Planning Time</title><link href="https://davidwangz137.github.io/planning-time.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-11-17T09:22:00+01:00</published><updated>2016-11-17T09:22:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Zhiyuan Wang</name></author><id>tag:davidwangz137.github.io,2016-11-17:planning-time.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I created this blog to keep me motivated to work hard. By letting everyone see what I've accomplished so far they can fit a local curve to where I should be in some short but significant time interval. Then I will feel some pressure to meet their expectations and become better. If I do become worse, then I can see this in evidence and then try to make things better instead of being in denial ("its not THAT bad"). Though some of the things I do will be risky and not yield any outcome for a long while (and may not even do anything in the end), by exposing them explicitly I won't forget why I'm doing them and how I calculated the reward/risk which let me take the decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why did I choose to write this instead of a journal? I noticed that in my journal my audience is only myself so my writing style never improves. As I publish more of these articles I'll read over them and realize how terrible the style is and then want to slowly improve my writing (since I'll be rereading the articles to check on my progress).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently I'm in my 3A term at Waterloo in a CS and CO double major. I have a lot of work ahead of me so I decided to preemptively procrastinate by creating this blog to replace the edgelord site that I had previously. Then as more posts come along I can invest more and more into the website as I see it is worth it. I've realized that motivation is a huge bottleneck for me so that is one way to overcome some situations where motivation is lacking is by careful reward/risk analysis. Investing only enough time to get a result where its efficient to add pieces at a time and not all at once is very good for such a mindset. Then the feedback from the task adds back to the motivation levels allowing more work to be done. This allows me to avoid things like starting on something and feeling made halfway because I didn't feel like I did jack shit for the day since I have nothing to show. Also this may make me more efficient by quiantifying things, though there is the overhead of quantification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And my writing is still terrible. There was no coherent organization in the last paragraph. Just a fucking mind-dump. I got too used to writing journals like this that this has become my style. Well, the journey of 1000 li starts with one step... onto an airplane which flies you the whole way.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry></feed>
